Hotspotizer allows users without computer programming skills to design, visualize, save and recall sets of custom full-body gestures, for use with the Microsoft Kinect. These gestures are mapped to system-wide keyboard commands which can be used to control any application.

Hotspotizer was my master's research project at the [Koç University Design Lab](http://designlab.ku.edu.tr). See [mbaytas/ma-thesis](https://github.com/mbaytas/ma-thesis) for the TeX source files and PDF of the thesis.

Hotspotizer has been featured on Microsoft's [Channel 9 Coding4Fun Kinect Projects blog](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/kinect/Todays-hot-project-Hotspotizer).

*This project was supported by the TÜBİTAK project *Specifications on a Design Education Methodology for Gestural Interface Design* (Grant #112E056,  2012-2014).*
