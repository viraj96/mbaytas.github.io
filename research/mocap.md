# understanding interpersonal communication through motion capture <small>(work in progress)</small>

Gestural communication is fundamental for interactions between humans, as it forms the key connection between language and real-world objects/locations. Thus it is critical to understanding human-human interaction. Beyond interpersonal communication, it also empowers a variety of human-computer interaction themes, e.g. spatial and gestural UIs, intelligent environments for collaboration, and human-robot interaction.

The goal of this project is to study and propose novel motion tracking technologies to efficiently perceive human gesture. Our research will initially focus on supporting research in linguistics and deictic communication. This involves exploring solutions to specific issues that researchers encounter. One of these issues is that existing general-purpose markerless motion capture solutions are convenient but imprecise, while more marker-based systems are accurate but expensive and difficult to use. The gap here could be addressed by special-purpose solutions for the tasks that are of interest to linguistics researchers. Another issue is the lack of tools that support coordination and co-analysis of speech and motion streams. Finally, there is a need for convenient data analysis tools, including supporting automating transcription and annotation.

Working closely with linguistics researchers, a user-centered design approach will be followed. Beyond addressing researchers’ needs, knowledge created through this process will inform HCI artifacts for home and work contexts.
